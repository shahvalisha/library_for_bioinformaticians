# library_for_bioinformaticians
I wanted to share some of my scripts that I worked towards in the past couple of years and I would like to create a library for myself and others! :)
Comments and suggestions are always welcome! 

### NMF
This was a very cool project, something that I always wanted to do. I came across a very big enough bulk rna seq data with end-to-end clinical data. Being on the forefront of a translational and clinical team I found this project right at the cross-section of transcriptomics and clinical data. 
My idea was around developing a model that can predict what therapeutic option should the patient have gone for based on their gene expression. 
As a bioinformatician that involves a very long data curation, QC and batch-correction. Merging all these different datasets across RNASeq, WES and clinical data was one of the first challenges that I faced. 
After that, i started working towards developing a full proof function for the NMF training, which is what I have uploaded here.
